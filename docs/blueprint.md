## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#673AB7) for a brain-like feel. The color evokes depth, intuition, and introspection, fitting for an app focused on cognitive awareness.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), a desaturated tint of the primary hue. Keeps the interface unobtrusive while still bearing some chromatic connection to the violet. Suits a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Light indigo (#3F51B5) a hue about 30 degrees from the primary in the direction of blue, and thus indigo; complements the violet but at greater saturation and less brightness. This makes it good for call-to-action buttons and details without overshadowing the primary violet.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that provides a modern, machined look that maintains neutrality and clean readability, which will lend clarity to the extensive feature set and focus scoring. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' , a computerized font with geometric, techy style to enhance dashboard with a mind-map layout and to keep things simple. A sans-serif face to bring simplicity and precision to this decision journal tool.
- Use minimalistic icons from Lucide to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Mind-map style dashboard layout with interconnected nodes, leveraging Framer Motion for fluid transitions and animations.
- Subtle animations for node pulsing, modal slide-ups, and chart loading to enhance user engagement.
